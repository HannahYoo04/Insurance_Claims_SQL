# Insurance_Claims_SQL
PostgreSQL squeries for insurance claims

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates relational database design and analytical SQL querying using PostgreSQL.

I designed and implemented a structured schema to manage insurance claims, staff assignments, and workflow tracking.


## Database Design
- Created relational tables with Primary Key and Foreign Key constraints
- Ensured referential integrity between:
  - Staff
  - Claims
  - Claim Assignments

## Analytical Queries
The project includes SQL queries to generate operational insights such as:

- Claim distribution by request type
- Active claim assignments
- Staff workload analysis
- Claims by contact channel
- Latest assignment tracking

## Skills Demonstrated
- Schema design & normalization
- JOIN operations
- GROUP BY & HAVING
- Subqueries
- Aggregation queries
- Analytical SQL for insight generation
